#Task:-
Write a program for following 3 problems.
1.	If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 4 or 5, we get 4, 5, and 8. The sum of these multiples is 17. Then find the sum of all the multiples of 4 or 5 below 1000.
2.	2520 is the smallest number that can be divided by each of the numbers from 1 to 10 without any remainder. What is the smallest positive number that is evenly divisible by all of the numbers from 1 to 20?
3.	The sum of the primes below 10 is 2 + 3 + 5 + 7 = 17. Find the sum of all the primes below two million.


#Approach to the problem:-

Three functions are written for each of the task and the main invokes the function call for each functions and the result ia printed by each function


#Functions used:-

1.printprimesum() :- the function call is invoked by main function calculates the sum of prime numbers below 2 million and prints the result at the end. It returns nothing also no input parameters are taken

2.printmultiples():-the function call is invoked by the main function calculates the sum of the multiples of 4 and 5 removing the common ones and prints their sum. It returns nothing and no input parameters are taken.

3.printleastnum():- the function call is invoked by the main function and it calculates the least number evenly divisible by all numbers from 1-20. It returns nothing and no input parameters are taken.

4.main function():- contains the function call for all the above functions and also prints a welcome message


#How to run the program:-

The program is saved as assignment.py.
The program can be cloned using
